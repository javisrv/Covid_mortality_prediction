# Repository rationale
- COVID-19 has caused more than 219 million infections worldwide and resulted in more than 4.55 million deaths. The COVID-19 disease has resulted in a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality across the world. COVID19 disease presents with a wide range of clinical features spanning from no symptoms to multi-organ failure and associated with high mortality.

- Since the epidemic, several mortality risk factors have been identified: genetic predisposing factors; demographic factors (older age and male sex); presence of comorbidities (cardiac, metabolic); several laboratory findings (lymphocyte count, lactic dehydrogenase, ferritin); imaging findings.

- The precise prognostication of COVID-19 clinical outcome is more challenging due to the high variability in disease severity that could essentially be helpful for efective triage and efcient allocation of limited resources (i.e., beds, ventilators). Clinical decisions are mainly based on expert opinion and clinical judgment. Stressful conditions and burnout in health care providers can reduce their clinical performance, and a lack of accurate judgment can lead to increased mortality rates.

- Machine Learning represents a novel tool for analyzing big data in medicine, including interactions among variables with respect to the prognostic outcome. 

# What is the purpose of this repository?
To apply Machine Learning based algorithms to generate a mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

# What is the source of the data?
The database used is publicly available on the Espírito Santo state portal: https://coronavirus.es.gov.br/painel-covid-19-es

# What files does this repository contain?
- Bibliography → This folder contains the bibliography that justifies the reasoning of this repository.
- COVID.ipynb → This file contains the cleaning and analysis of the dataset. In turn, it generates a file called "to_model.csv" which will be used for the ML models.
